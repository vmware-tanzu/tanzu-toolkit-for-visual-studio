## Getting Started

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions, provide feedback or simply submit issues when you encounter them.

Of course, we also accept code contributions by submitting pull requests (PR) with code changes.

## Reporting Issues

If you want to report an issue, then please open an issue in the repository.

You will find that this is the best way to get your issue addressed. Please be as detailed as you can be about the problem. Providing a minimal project with code that illustrates the problem along with a description of the steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.

Before reporting an issue, go through the list below and ask yourself these questions.  This will make sure you're not missing any important information before opening up an issue.

1. Did you read the documentation?
1. Do you have the snippet of broken code or a sample project for the issue?
1. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
1. Is the problem still there in the latest version of the package?

Make sure before you submit the issue to check the formatting of the content. Remember that GitHub supports [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) formatting in the issue content.

## Feature Requests

The best way to get new feature requests implemented is by contributing code. That said, if you don't feel you have time or the ability to contribute code, then please feel free to start a discussion around your idea by creating a feature/enhancement request on GitHub. 

## Contributing Code

We welcome code contributions from the community. 

### General Contribution Guidelines

* Please include tests when adding new features. We recommend when fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
* Please keep all discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up it's often better to create new thread of discussion than to side track the discussion.
* Please don't surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
* Please don't commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.
* Please don't submit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.
* Please don't add API additions without filing an issue and discussing with us first.
* Please tag any users that should know about and/or review the changes you are wanting to contribute.
